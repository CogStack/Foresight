Deep Generative Modelling of Patient Timelines using Electronic Health Records

We present a novel deep learning generative model of patients using EHRs that is composed of both natural language processing and a longitudinal forecasting, which has broad utility across many healthcare domains. We anticipate further iterative improvements as all subcomponents are improvable. Foresight opens the door for digital health twins, synthetic dataset generation, real world risk estimation, longitudinal research, emulation of virtual trials, medical education and more.
